# WebApp boilerplate with React JS
[![Open in Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/button/open-in-gitpod.svg)](https://gitpod.io#https://github.com/4GeeksAcademy/react-hello-webapp.git)

### Requirements:
- Make sure you are using node version 8

##### Install the packages:
```
$ npm install
```

## Start coding!
Start the webpack server with live reload:
`$ npm run start` for windows, mac, linux or Gitpod.

### Styles
You can update the `styles/index.scss` or create new `.scss` files inside `styles/` and import them into your current scss or js files depending on your needs.

### Components
Add more files into your `./src/js/components` or styles folder as you need them and import them into your current files as needed.


ðŸ’¡Note: There is an example using the Context API inside `views/demo.js`;

### Views (Components)
Add more files into your `./src/js/views` and import them in `./src/js/layout.jsx`.

### Context
This boilerplate comes with a centralized general Context API. The file `./src/js/store/flux.js` has a base structure for the store, we encourage you to change it and adapt it to your needs.

React Context [docs](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html)
BreathCode Lesson [view](https://content.breatheco.de/lesson/react-hooks-explained)

The `Provider` is already set. You can consume from any component using the useContext hook to get the `store` and `actions` from the Context. Check `/views/demo.js` to see a demo.

```jsx
import { Context } from "../store/appContext";
const MyComponentSuper = () => {
  //here you use useContext to get store and actions
  const { store, actions } = useContext(Context);
  return <div>{/* you can use your actions or store inside the html */}</div>
}
```
